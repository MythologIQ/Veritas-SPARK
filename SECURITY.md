## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Email**: security@veritas-spark.dev (example - replace with actual)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Do NOT** create a public issue for security vulnerabilities

### What to Include

Please include the following information:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact if exploited
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands demonstrating the issue (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### Response Timeline

| Stage | Target Timeframe |
|-------|------------------|
| Acknowledgment | 24-48 hours |
| Initial Assessment | 3-5 business days |
| Fix Development | Depends on severity |
| Security Advisory | Within 24 hours of fix |

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Critical | Remote code execution, data breach | 24 hours |
| High | Sandbox escape, privilege escalation | 48 hours |
| Medium | Bypass of security controls | 5 business days |
| Low | Minor security improvements | Next release |

## Security Best Practices

### Deployment

1. **Enable all security features** by default
2. **Configure audit logging** to track security events
3. **Use model encryption** for sensitive models
4. **Set appropriate rate limits** for your workload
5. **Run with minimal privileges** (sandbox user)

### Configuration

```rust
// Recommended security configuration
let security = SecurityConfig {
    enable_prompt_injection_filter: true,
    enable_pii_detection: true,
    enable_output_sanitization: true,
    block_high_risk_prompts: true,
    audit_log_path: Some(PathBuf::from("./logs/audit.json")),
    ..Default::default()
};
```

### Environment

- **AUTH_TOKEN**: Set a strong authentication token
- **SANDBOX_USER**: Run as a restricted user account
- **RESOURCE_LIMITS**: Configure appropriate memory/CPU limits

## Security Audit

### Test Coverage

| Category | Tests |
|----------|-------|
| Prompt Injection | 11 |
| PII Detection | 13 |
| Output Sanitization | 8 |
| Model Encryption | 11 |
| Input Validation | 8 |
| Path Traversal | 5 |
| Sandbox Escape | 6 |
| Adversarial Input | 8 |
| Hash Verification | 5 |
| Auth/Session | 4 |
| **Total** | **43** |

### Running Security Tests

```powershell
# Run all security tests
cargo test --lib security::

# Run specific security module tests
cargo test --lib security::prompt_injection
cargo test --lib security::pii_detector
cargo test --lib security::output_sanitizer
cargo test --lib security::encryption
```
