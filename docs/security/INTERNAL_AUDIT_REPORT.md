| ID | Issue | Status | Reference |
|----|-------|--------|-----------|
| CVE-004 | TOCTOU in Persistence | FIXED | Direct file operations |
| CVE-005 | K8s CRD Input Validation | FIXED | Comprehensive validation |
| CVE-006 | IPC Message Size Race | FIXED | Atomic size enforcement |

---

### 3.4 Low Severity Findings (2)

#### LOW-001: unwrap() Usage in Non-Critical Paths

**Location:** Various files (205 instances identified)
**Risk:** Potential panic in edge cases

**Assessment:**
- 67% of instances are in test code (acceptable)
- Remaining instances reviewed for criticality
- Production paths use proper error handling

**Mitigation:** Documented, low priority for refactoring

**Status:** ACCEPTED

---

#### LOW-002: Hardcoded Salt in Machine ID Derivation

**Location:** `security/encryption.rs:159, 178`
```rust
let salt = b"hearthlink-core-salt";
```

**Risk:** Same salt across installations reduces entropy

**Assessment:**
- Salt is combined with unique machine ID
- Key derivation uses PBKDF2 with 100K iterations
- Practical impact is minimal given machine ID uniqueness

**Mitigation:** Document in deployment guide; consider per-installation salt in future version

**Status:** ACCEPTED

---

### 3.5 Informational Findings (4)

#### INFO-001: Session ID Length

**Observation:** Session IDs are 64 hex characters (256 bits)
**Assessment:** Exceeds minimum requirements; no action needed
**Status:** INFORMATIONAL

---

#### INFO-002: Rate Limiting Window

**Observation:** Rate limiting uses 60-second sliding window
**Assessment:** Appropriate for IPC context; configurable if needed
**Status:** INFORMATIONAL

---

#### INFO-003: Audit Log Retention

**Observation:** In-memory audit logs have 10,000 event limit
**Assessment:** Appropriate for runtime; external SIEM recommended for production
**Status:** INFORMATIONAL

---

#### INFO-004: Legacy ECB Decryption Disabled

**Observation:** Legacy ECB decryption returns error; migration path documented
**Assessment:** Correct security decision; users must re-encrypt files
**Status:** INFORMATIONAL
