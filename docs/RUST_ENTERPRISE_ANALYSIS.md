### 5.3 Enterprise Sales Positioning

| Objection           | Response                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Why not Python?"   | Python has GC pauses (unpredictable latency), memory safety issues, and requires runtime. Rust provides deterministic performance and single-binary deployment. |
| "Why not Go?"       | Go has GC pauses and is less performant for compute-intensive workloads. Rust provides zero-cost abstractions and no runtime overhead.                          |
| "Why not C++?"      | C++ has memory safety vulnerabilities (70% of CVEs). Rust eliminates entire bug classes while matching C++ performance.                                         |
| "Rust is new/risky" | Rust is used in Linux kernel, Windows, Android, and by AWS. It's ISO standardized and has 10+ years of development.                                             |

## 8. Conclusion

**Rust is not a liability for Veritas SPARK - it is a strategic asset.**

The language's memory safety guarantees enable the security features that differentiate Veritas SPARK from all competitors. Its performance characteristics enable the deterministic latency that enterprise deployments require.

Major enterprises (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta) have validated Rust for production use. The Linux kernel and Windows operating system have adopted Rust. This is not experimental technology - it is enterprise-proven.

For Veritas SPARK, Rust enables:

- **Security features impossible in other languages** (true memory-safe sandboxing)
- **Performance impossible in GC languages** (deterministic latency)
- **Deployment simplicity impossible in interpreted languages** (single binary)

The question is not "Why Rust?" but "Why would you trust an inference runtime written in anything else?"
