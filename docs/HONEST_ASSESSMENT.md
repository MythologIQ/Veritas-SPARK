# Veritas SPARK: Honest Assessment

**Document Purpose:** Transparent, evidence-based evaluation of claims
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Living Document

---

## Executive Summary

Veritas SPARK (Secure Performance-Accelerated Runtime Kernel) is a **security-first inference runtime** with real advantages for specific use cases. This document provides an honest assessment of what we've built, what's verified, and what needs validation.

---

## 1. What We Can Honestly Claim

### 1.1 Verified Advantages

| Claim                               | Evidence                                      | Confidence |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **No network dependencies**         | Cargo.toml audit, forbidden dependencies list | ✅ High    |
| **Single binary distribution**      | All dependencies MIT/Apache, static linking   | ✅ High    |
| **Rust memory safety**              | Language guarantee, no unsafe in core         | ✅ High    |
| **361ns infrastructure overhead**   | Benchmark verified                            | ✅ High    |
| **Comprehensive security features** | 43 tests passing, 55+ injection patterns      | ✅ Medium  |
| **Air-gapped deployment**           | No external dependencies, no telemetry        | ✅ High    |

### 1.2 Qualified Claims (Need Context)

| Claim                                  | Context                                         | Confidence                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **"2,770x faster than HTTP runtimes"** | True but expected - HTTP adds latency by design | ⚠️ Misleading without context |
| **"95/100 security score"**            | Internal assessment only                        | ⚠️ Needs independent audit    |
| **"Enterprise ready"**                 | Architecture is, but no production deployments  | ⚠️ Needs battle-testing       |

### 1.3 What We Cannot Claim (Yet)

| Claim                     | Gap                            | What's Needed               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **"World's most secure"** | No independent audit           | Third-party security review |
| **"Fastest inference"**   | No direct llama.cpp comparison | Benchmark vs llama.cpp CLI  |
| **"Production proven"**   | No deployments                 | Pilot program               |
| **"GPU support"**         | Not implemented                | CUDA/Metal backend          |

---

## 2. HTTP vs IPC Comparison: Fair but Expected

### Why It's Fair

- HTTP-based runtimes (Ollama, vLLM, TGI) are the **standard deployment model**
- Users choosing between runtimes should understand the overhead trade-off
- The comparison shows real-world impact of architecture choices

### Why It's Not Surprising

| Architecture          | Overhead | Why                                              |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **HTTP/REST**         | 1-10 ms  | JSON serialization, TCP handshake, HTTP parsing  |
| **IPC (Veritas SPARK)** | 361 ns   | Binary protocol, shared memory, no network stack |

**The math:** HTTP is inherently slower. Our advantage is choosing NOT to use HTTP, not inventing faster IPC.

## 3. llama.cpp Direct Comparison: What Would It Show?

### Why This Matters

Veritas SPARK uses llama.cpp bindings (`llama-cpp-2` crate). The fair comparison is:

```
Veritas SPARK overhead = Veritas SPARK latency - llama.cpp CLI latency
```

### What We Expect

| Component             | Expected Overhead | Reason                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **IPC layer**         | ~361 ns           | Benchmark verified              |
| **Security scanning** | ~1-5 ms           | Pattern matching, PII detection |
| **Sandbox overhead**  | ~0.1-1 ms         | Job Object limits               |
| **Total overhead**    | ~2-7 ms           | Security features add latency   |

### What This Would Prove

| Scenario              | Interpretation                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Overhead < 10 ms**  | Security features are efficient  |
| **Overhead 10-50 ms** | Acceptable for security benefits |
| **Overhead > 50 ms**  | Need optimization                |

### Why We Haven't Done It Yet

1. llama.cpp CLI doesn't have identical security features
2. Need to isolate: inference time vs security overhead
3. Fair comparison requires same model, same hardware, same parameters

## 4. Transparent Claims Update

### Before (Marketing)

> "The world's most secure, efficient, and powerful inference runtime"

### After (Honest)

| **Competitive infrastructure**  | 361 ns overhead, 2,770x faster than HTTP-based alternatives                |

### Claims We Cannot Make (Yet)

| Claim                 | Gap                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |

## 5. Gap Analysis and Remediation Plan

### 5.1 Critical Gaps

| Gap                               | Priority | Remediation             | Timeline  |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| **No llama.cpp direct benchmark** | P0       | Create benchmark script | 1 week    |
| **No independent security audit** | P0       | Engage security firm    | 4-8 weeks |
| **No GPU support**                | P1       | Implement CUDA backend  | 4-6 weeks |
| **No production deployments**     | P1       | Pilot program           | 2-4 weeks |

### 5.2 Benchmark Plan: vs llama.cpp Direct

```bash
# Test methodology
1. Same model: phi-3-mini-q4km.gguf
2. Same hardware: CPU-only (for now)
3. Same parameters: max_tokens=256, temp=0.7

# Measurements
- llama.cpp CLI: time to first token, tokens/sec, total latency
- Veritas SPARK: same metrics + security overhead breakdown

# Expected outcome
- Quantify exact overhead of security features
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Provide honest comparison for users
```

### 5.3 Security Audit Plan

| Scope                   | Method                 | Deliverable             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Code audit**          | Third-party firm       | Vulnerability report    |
| **Penetration test**    | Red team               | Attack surface analysis |
| **Dependency audit**    | `cargo audit` + manual | Supply chain report     |
| **Architecture review** | Security architect     | Threat model update     |
